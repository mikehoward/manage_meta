* lib/manage_meta/manage_meta.rb (included) restored 'included' to conditionally invoke 'helper_method'
    on 'render_meta'.
  corrected visibility of methods and moved public & protected macros to bottom of module

* versions 0.0.6 & 0.0.7 - in rapid succession

* tests/manage_meta_test.rb (many): added tests for _manage_meta_init.

* lib/manage_meta/manage_meta.rb (included): deleted 'included' method
    and all the fancy stuff - couldn't make it work because it required hacking into
    'initialize' - which seems to be a special method which is hard to hack.
   (_manage_meta_init): new method which initializes required instance variables

* lib/manage_meta/manage_meta.rb (included): added guards to old_initialize logic to cover the
   case where initialize is not defined - as in Rails3 running under Ruby 1.8.7
   (_manage_meta_name_to_sym, _manage_meta_sym_to_name): new functions which do what they say they
     will do. These support converting all hash keys to symbols and emitting meta tag names
     as Capitalized words joined by hyphens.
   (add_meta, del_meta, render_meta): modified to use manage_meta_...to... calls
   test/manage_meta_test.rb (ManageMetaTest): modified to test for symbols as keys and capitalized
     words in rendering. Added test to make sure included works properly for a class w/o an initialize
     method

* manage_meta.gem (s.version): changed to 0.0.5

* README.markdown: brought up to date with changes to hashes. Corrected many errors in content
    and formatting.
